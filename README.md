Welcome to my kahoot hack *USE AT OWN RISK*
If you get banned dont blame me i made this just for fun
This is still in construction 
How to use:
Copy this link: fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EShrestha/kaheet/main/src/Run.js").then((a) => a.text().then((b) => eval(b).then((c) => eval(c))))
But it in a bookmark but like this: Javascript: (then the code)
Press in a match
Click the yellow text bubble with eyes
Look for the matches game (exact)
Look at the url
Example: https://create.kahoot.it/details/cdcf19dc-683b-4203-8a77-45a076a12a32
Take eyerthing off except the end code like this
Example:cdcf19dc-683b-4203-8a77-45a076a12a32
Paste that into the yellow text bubble guy
Now you can select auto piolet or incognito 
Auto piolet auto answers 
Incognito rounds the cornor of the correct answer insted of it being pointy
If you dont press anything it will highlight the correct answer
You dont need to press stuff again every question
Enjoy and *USE AT OWN RISK*
If you get banned it not my fault
